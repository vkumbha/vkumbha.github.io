AWS has recently [announced](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-public-ipv4-address-charge-public-ip-insights) a new charge for public IPv4 addresses (effective February 1, 2024). There will be a charge of $0.005 per IP per hour for all public IPv4 addresses, whether attached to a service or not (there is already a charge for public IPv4 addresses you allocate in your account but donâ€™t attach to an EC2 instance).

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io/) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL. We will track the usage of public IPv4 addresses using Steampipe and answer questions like:

  * How many Public IPv4 addresses do I have?
  * How many Public IPv4 addresses are unassociated?
  * How much does it cost for my Public IPs today?
  * How much will it cost with the new charge?
  * How many Public IPs do I have by Account/Region?

There is good [documentation](https://steampipe.io/docs) available on Steampipe [installation](https://steampipe.io/downloads) and initial setup process, so we will skip these topics here. Use the [AWS plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws) to query the tables [aws_ec2_network_interface](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables/aws_ec2_network_interface) and 
[aws_vpc_eip](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables/aws_vpc_eip) to get the list of Public IPs. With the magic of Steampipe [aggregators](https://steampipe.io/docs/managing/connections#using-aggregators) we can run this query across multiple AWS Accounts.
