Hello There,
  In this post, we will talk about the recent changes that AWS has introduced to charge the attached IPv4 address. We will use a steampipe query to get the list of IPv4 public address we have. With the magic of aggregators, we can get the same data across multiple accounts/organizations.

We will also build a dashboard which will answer questions like:
* How much costs impact do I have?
* Which service do I focus first to move to IPv6 (hoiping that is it supported. For list of IPv6 supported please check here)
